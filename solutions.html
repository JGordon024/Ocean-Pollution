            People are one of the most invaluable resources that can be used to fix this mess. People can dedicate their time and efforts and volunteer to assist in cleaning up the beaches. The main reason as to why this solution is very promising is that it’s killing two birds with one stone. On one end, it's getting people, those who are responsible for ocean pollution, out to help clean the mess that they have taken part of. Secondly, it’s raising awareness of ocean pollution, giving the volunteers a first hand view as to how badly this situation is, which can “inspire people to make change” (“Trash Art”) and help raise awareness to get others to volunteer as well. As more people volunteer and more awareness is raised, the beaches could be cleaned up at a faster pace. This could possibly save animals, both birds and fish alike. Cleaning the beaches could also prevent further ocean pollution, and overall help the ecosystem. It should also be mentioned that it is important that people take part in fixing this problem. It can not be ignored that it is because of people that ocean pollution exist in the first place. With people cleaning up the oceans, future generations might stand a higher chance in eradicating ocean pollution all together.
            <h1>What's wrong with this?</h1>
            Unfortunately, this really only focuses on the trash on the beaches. Essentially, while cleaning up the beaches can prevent further issues within the ocean, the majority of the issue is within the ocean. Cleaning up the beaches might prevent the problem from growing, but it will not be highly effective at fixing the existing trash in the ocean. Trash might often enough enter the ocean through the beach, but even by keeping the beaches clean, ocean pollution persist beyond the reach of volunteering citizens. With this knowledge, it could deter some from volunteering. They might feel as though their efforts are a waste of time, and that they would not make much of a difference. And as a result, fewer people volunteer, which makes cleaning up the beaches a much slower process, reducing its effectiveness.

                    Furthermore, another solution is to produce technological and scientific advancements that will assist in cleaning up the ocean. Through these advancements, scientists will be able to “rid the oceans of a large amount of trash” (“A Success for the Ocean Cleanup”) in a much more effective and efficient manner. After decades of trash, chemicals, oil, and sewage being dumped into and polluting the ocean, ocean pollution has grown to extremely large scale. With that being said, it can only be successfully decreased with an increase of inventions that can remove trash from the ocean in large quantities. By targeting the large amount of trash in the ocean, more sea life can be spared from consuming trash, especially endangered creatures. The ecosystem will be more likely to flourish, and less damage would be done. Trash within the ocean, especially plastic due to the fact that it doesn’t decompose, is a large part of the problem. Most logically it should be focused on and reduced as much as possible.
                    <h1>What's wrong with this?</h1>
                    On the downside, this could be a very long process. This can already be seen by a Dutch inventor, Boyan Slat, when it took him seven years to bring an idea he had to reality. After which it took an additional year after his first prototype failed. Other inventions might not be as long of a process, but the point remains that these inventions and other scientific advancements can take a long time. And even once they’ve been completed, they might fail and take more time to perfect. It is also possible that by the time that scientists or engineers make the advancements necessary to make progress with ocean pollution, the initial problem might have changed. Or even caused more damage, possibly irreversible. The time it takes to think of these advancements, then to act on them and see them through development and the trials it would have to endure to ensure its success makes it all the much more less effective.

        <span>While there are many great solutions that can assist with cleaning up the ocean, there is only one that can be seen as the most effective at targeting and combating ocean pollution.</span>
            It is clear that focusing on technological innovations and other scientific advancements would be the most effective at reducing and reversing the damage done within the ocean. This is a result of many different reasons, but the primary reason is the fact that “sewage, debris, toxic chemicals, heavy metals, oil and radioactive waste” (Hardin) are all significant causes of ocean pollution. With more scientific advancements towards eliminating these problems, ocean pollution can come to an end much sooner, and the damages that result from ocean pollution can be minimized. Inventions can remove the plastic from the ocean, or even help track trash. Other advancements could help with the removal of waste, oil, and the likes. Unfortunately, there are those who would point out that to create these inventions and focus on advancements would require a great sum of money. An example of this is Slat’s invention that targeted the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, which was a $20 million project. This is just one invention that targets cleaning the ocean, and with more inventions and research being put in, the costs will only rise. Although this is a valid concern, society is already forced to pay $2.5 trillion a year, so the financial burdens are not new. In fact, this could save money in the long run. With money being invested now into turning the tide in ocean pollution, future generations will not have to deal with ocean pollution. As a result, they will not need to spend excessive amounts of money into combating ocean pollution. It should also be mentioned that a price can not be put on saving the ocean. Ocean pollution is a result of mankind’s reckless ways of living, and there is no price you can put on reserving the damage that people have done to this world.

            Another reason as to why this solution is the best is due to the fact that these scientific advancements could also assist in finding ways to decompose plastic, or make plastic that is able to be decomposed. As it is, “many plastics take as long as 500 years to decompose” (Hardin), but that could be greatly reduced. With enough research and time, it could be possible to find a way to decompose plastic, or create a new material to replace plastic that would be more eco friendly. By making a compostable plastic or new material, it would allow for products to be able to break down and not become a threat to the ocean, or break down when it enters the ocean and still not pose a threat to the sea life. If a new method for decomposing plastic was found, it would be able to be used to break down new plastic products that are being used, as well as older plastic products, which in turn would prevent them from endangering the ocean.
